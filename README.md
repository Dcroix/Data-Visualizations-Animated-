# Data-Visualizations-Animated-
This repository is composed of different Animated Data Visualizations I have created for purposes of including it in my project portfolio for Data Science. 

[Sample Only COVID-19 Cases Per Million Feb 2020 - April 2022 ](http://www.ptcsitesresearch.com/p/sample-only-covid-19-cases-per-million.html)
This data visualization displays an animated bar chart that presents the top countries in terms of COVID-19 cases total per million from Feb. 2020 to April 2022 (Sample for Project Purposes Only). The IDE used is Spyder, the language is Python, and libraries include pandas, bar_chart_race, and researchpy.
